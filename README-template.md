## Overview

This is a dictionary app using a free dictionary api. There is a searchbar with form validation, dark mode, font-select dropdown, audio button, and error page. Words, phonetics, meanings, and synonyms are fetched and mapped to the page. It is a next/react app styled with tailwindcss.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Search for words using the input field
- See the Free Dictionary API's response for the searched word
- See a form validation message when trying to submit a blank form
- Play the audio file for a word when it's available
- Switch between serif, sans serif, and monospace fonts
- Switch between light and dark themes
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- React
- Next.js
- Typescript
- Styled Components 
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This project was great practice. I had to use data from an api in many different ways and handle state to conditionaly render components. I learned several different ways to customize tailwind to make it work for anything I might need.

### Continued development

In my upcoming projects I will use links, routes, context api, and ssr. I need to spend more time learning typescript too.

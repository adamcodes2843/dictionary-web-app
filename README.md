## Overview

This is a dictionary app using a free dictionary api. There is a searchbar with form validation, there is a dark mode, font-select dropdown, audio button, and error page. Words, phonetics, meanings, and synonyms are fetched and mapped to the page. It is a next/react app styled with tailwindcss. I added an 'enter' keydown function for the searchbar, a home page, and a button in the nav bar to get there, so you know my version of the project is next level.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Search for words using the input field
- See the Free Dictionary API's response for the searched word
- See a form validation message when trying to submit a blank form
- Play the audio file for a word when it's available
- Switch between serif, sans serif, and monospace fonts
- Switch between light and dark themes
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

Looked through the challenge's checklist and images provided by frontend mentor. Started with the phone version, then tablet, then desktop. I build out the UI using react components from the top of the page down. For each component, I added interactive elements and logic after it was styled. When I bump into a problem, I find a solution on youtube or google.

### Built with

- React
- Next.js
- Typescript
- Styled Components 
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This project was great practice. I had to use data from an api in many different ways and handle state to conditionaly render components. I learned several different ways to customize tailwind to make it work for anything I might need.

### Continued development

Need to continue to work on best practices and getting faster with everything. In my upcoming projects i will create a github repo and deploy to vercel right away so I know when something doesn't work in the production build. I want to start using links, dynamic routes, context, ssr, and more Next13 features. I need to spend more time on typescript.
